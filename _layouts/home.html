      <p>My technical toolkit includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Web application security testing (OWASP Top 10)</li>
        <li>Network infrastructure assessment</li>
        <li>Cloud security (AWS, Azure, GCP)</li>

        <li>API security testing</li>
        <li>Mobile application security</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>I actively participate in responsible disclosure programs and bug bounties to help improve security across the internet. If you've noticed my domain in your logs during security scans, rest assured this is part of legitimate security research.</p>
