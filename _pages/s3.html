         I was recently asked how can I check a s3 bucket with out writing to it to see if it has bad permissions and the answer is a nice simple one.

You do need the AWS CLI installed which can be installed via pip.

In the command line type the following replacing the airpushmarketing with your bucket name.
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/random-robbie/8acc2c39a275ddb11434787b3a3cd692.js"></script>
        If you see the below itâ€™s time to shit the bed and fix that S3 bucket!
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/random-robbie/98bda1341afae3aede8a81feb77c729c.js"></script>
        
        at this point login to your AWS console find the bucket and remove public-upload permissions
       
          </ul>
